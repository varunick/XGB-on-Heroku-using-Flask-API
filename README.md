# Interest-rate-predictions-for-loan-applicants

This was a hackathon published on Analytics Vidya. 

The process, defined as ‘risk-based pricing’, uses a sophisticated algorithm that leverages different determining factors of a loan applicant. Selection of significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can estimate loan interest rates based on clients’ information. On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on clients information. Here, the goal was to use a training dataset to predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3) that will be assigned to each loan in our test set.
